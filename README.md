<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That's where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

## License

Cal.com, Inc. is a commercial open source company, which means some parts of this open source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called "Open Core" where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and the last 1% is covered under a commercial license (["/ee" Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/packages/features/ee)) which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organisations that require enterprise features. Enterprise features are built by the core engineering team of Cal.com, Inc. which is hired in full-time. Find their compensation on https://cal.com/open.

> [!NOTE]  
> Our philosophy is simple, all "Singleplayer APIs" are open-source under AGPLv3. All commercial "Multiplayer APIs" are under a commercial license.


> [!TIP]
> We work closely with the community and always invite feedback about what should be open and what is fine to be commercial. This list is not set and stone and we have moved things from commercial to open in the past. Please open a [discussion] if you feel like something is wrong.

## Enabling Content Security Policy

- Set CSP_POLICY="non-strict" env variable, which enables Strict CSP except for unsafe-inline in style-src . If you have some custom changes in your instance, you might have to make some code change to make your instance CSP compatible. Right now it enables strict CSP only on login page and on other SSR pages it is enabled in Report only mode to detect possible issues. On, SSG pages it is still not supported.
